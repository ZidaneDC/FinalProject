# FinalProject
2D Tactical RPG, enemy teams can move and attack and defeat the other sides units, and create new units for their own sides.
CLicking on Units when its their sides turn will allow the player to choose where they move.
If an enemy is in range, they can be clicked on to be attacked.
Right clicking on any unit displays their stats.
Both sides will earn gold from chests for each turn.
Clicking on the arrows of each respective side will open a menu that allows for creation of new Units for a price of gold
Press spacebar to switch turns.
Edited final build upload has a more recent upload date due to the removal of older, unusable zipped builds to avoid confusion.
The older zip uploads lacked the Mono and project data folders, which I was not aware were needed in the same directory for the app to work. The project itself has not changed though, it was completed by the due date of the final and remains the same as the final commit.
